# League

What goes here? I don't know.

I realize someone else should have written the description.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have your own League API key, be aware these expire every two days so if your requests are responding with 404 make sure you have a valid key.
* You must have a League account in order to get an API key
* [Get key](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
* Store your keys in your own secrets.js file
  -> LEAGUE_API_KEY = "your league key"

### Prerequisites

* A LoL account is needed in order to obtain a LoL API key.


## Running the tests

npm run test to run all available test. You can also run a specific test


```
npm run test #runs all the tests
npm run test-champion-routes # runs tests for champion routes
```

### Api routes and testing

* As you make API routes make sure to write out tests and include the test run script in package.json. All though more time consuming on initial setup it will speed up development when we don't have to manually test each time.

### Components and Tests

* As you make components make sure to write out tests and include the test run script in package.json. All though more time consuming on initial setup it will speed up development when we don't have to manually test each time.


## Built With

* [LoL API](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
